Our computer has a diorama of dinosaurs. Dr. John Hammond was the CEO and creator Jurrasic Park. 

Hammond is in charge of running the park. The park has features (LED devices) and shows (routines which do things with the LEDs, audio and the PC Speaker). 

Hammond shuts the lights off in the evening and support scheduling. It is also the target for the acpi power button script, so we can press the power button to enqueue a new random show.


TODO
