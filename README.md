Our computer has a diorama of dinosaurs. Dr. John Hammond was the CEO and creator Jurrasic Park, hence the name. 

Hammond the daemon runs my computer's diorama. Functionality includes:

* Handling the power button press. 
	- My power button doesn't turn the computer off. Instead it will trigger an effect at random
* Handle night light shutdown and morning lights on
* Randomly play gentle rain or ocean effects throughout the day, including fading the clouds and animating ocean waves.

In my setup there are five main lighting effects right now:
 * Sun - The LEDs built into the top case fan
 * Clouds - An LED strip
 * Ocean - An LED strip
 * Volcano - An LED strip
 * Tree - An LED strip
 * Background - Some motherboard LEDs

Musical sounds are played through a speaker hidden in the bottom of the case. Beep sounds are played through the PC motherboard speaker.
