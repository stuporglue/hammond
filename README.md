Our computer has a diorama of dinosaurs. Dr. John Hammond was the CEO and creator Jurrasic Park. 

Hammond the daemon runs my computer's diorama. Expected functionality includes:

* Handling the power button press. 
	- My power button doesn't turn the computer off. Instead it will trigger a lighting effect at random
* Handle night light shutdown and morning lights on
* Run lighting changes throughout the day

In my setup there are three main lighting effects right now:
 * Clouds
 * Ocean
 * Volcano

When a specific effect is triggered, there might be flashing lights and a sound effects played, or something. 

The rest of the time, the clouds should gently change between different shades of white/grey, the ocean should gently change colors and the volcanoe should have a peaceful bubbling lava color effect.
